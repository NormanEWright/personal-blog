# My Personal Blog
This project is the initial build out of my web development blog - static version. I'll be creating the main pages which includes the Home/Blog, About me, Contact pages. In addition, there will be a Search, Category and 404 page.


The static version of the site utilizes:
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap)
* Javascript
* Fontawesome

Once completed, the site will be converted to a custom WordPress theme.

The primary goal for my blog is to share my coursework and personal projects.
